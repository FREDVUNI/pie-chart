Pie Divided is a simple web application that allows you to visually divide a pie into different sections using HTML and CSS. It's a fun way to demonstrate how to create visually appealing designs with just a few lines of code.

## Usage

Once you have the project running in your browser, you can start dividing the pie into sections:

1. Hover over the pie to highlight individual sections.
2. Click on a section to change its color.
3. Adjust the size of the sections by modifying the CSS properties in the `styles.css` file.
